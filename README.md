# Structured Chaos

A full-stack personal dashboard that transforms scattered inspiration into a structured, navigable system.

Structured Chaos is a private digital workspace designed to organize ideas, references, interests, and curated resources in one intentional interface. It balances creativity and structure — turning chaos into clarity.

## 🧠 Concept

Structured Chaos represents the intersection of:

- **Creativity** → Ideas, inspirations, bookmarks, lifestyle references  
- **Structure** → Categorization, modular layout, systemized design  

This is not a social platform.  
It is a personal indexing system.
